\chapter{Introduction}
\section{Initial Situation}
The NoBeard environment is developed to support the courses of Theoretical Informatics conducted for third grade students of the Department of Informatics at the HTBLA Leonding. The project was introduced by Prof. DI Peter Bauer with the purpose that students get the possibility to gain some experience in the topic of system programming. 

The NoBeard tools consists of a stack based virtual machine, an assembler and a basic compiler with the corresponding language. The components here are developed in the simplest way  to facilitate the operation of the user as much as possible.

\section{Goals}
The general goal of this thesis was to extend the already existing NoBeard project by a graphical user interface to make the use of the virtual machine more simple. It was the highest priority to meet all the usability requirements. Amongst other things, it includes a better and easier use of the virtual machine compared to command line interfaces. Through the advantages of a GUI users are able to get a better overview of an assembler program execution and its data memory state.

The other major goal of this continuation project was the introducing of a debugger into this system. This tool need to cover nearly all basic debugger functionalities for assembler programs such as toggling breakpoints or stepping through assembler instruction. Of course, the concept should support as well CLI as GUI devices.

\section{Structure of the Thesis}
\subsection{Formal Languages}
This chapter is intended to provide a rough overview of formal languages, their structure (grammars) and usefulness. It gives also a short description about the syntax of a language.
\subsection{The NoBeard Machine Architecture}
A detailed description of the NoBeard virtual machine and its components. It gives a basis background knowledge about how a simple machine is built up with a call stack, data memory work etc\ldots
\subsection{User Manual}
A typical user manual for the graphical user interface of the NoBeard virtual machine. Here is explained step by step how to use the different functionalities of the machine. 
\subsection{Implementation}
This is about the detailed description of the realization and implementation of the graphical user interface its functionalities. Here, the reader will be confronted with some quite interesting topics such as observer pattern or thread synchronization.
